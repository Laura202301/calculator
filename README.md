 On-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

 This project is a simple web-based calculator application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes features like decimal point input, handling keyboard inputs, and clearing/resetting the calculator. 
 
 Users can interact with the calculator using both mouse clicks on buttons and keyboard inputs. The code defines functions for performing arithmetic operations, handling button clicks and keyboard events, and updating the display to reflect the current calculations and inputs. 
 
 The user interface consists of buttons for numbers, operators, and control actions, along with a display area for showing the entered numbers and the ongoing calculation process.
